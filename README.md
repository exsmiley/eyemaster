Eyemaster can be used by cloning the repo, turning on developer mode for Chrome extensions, choosing to load an unpacked extension, and choosing the `ext` directory in the repo. Once the extension is enabled, you will be able to master your productivity using your eyes.

### Todos

 - Figure out how to run webgazer in the background script so we don't need to allow webcam access on every page + potentially gets rid of https issue
 - Add more shortcuts
 - Allow customization of shortcuts
 - Clean up hackathon code to make more maintainable
 - Maybe scrap extension idea and turn into node.js desktop application so can use anywhere
 - Contribute to WebGazer to improve on gazing functionality

 **Many thanks to [WebGazer](https://github.com/brownhci/WebGazer) for exposing the webgazing and blink detection capabilities!**
